  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <img src="ct_photo1.png" alt="">
  <p><strong>Curbside Thai</strong> brings the rich flavor of Thailand to
  North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35
  years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers
  that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte
  with our modern mobile food truck.</p>

  <p>This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy
  paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various
  mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from
  11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and
  11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the
  difference! If you can't get away from your desk,
  <em>Curbside Thai will deliver</em>.</p>

  <p>Contact us to cater your next party and experience
  what <cite>Carolina Traveler</cite> calls <q>the finest Asian food
  on or off the streets of Charlotte</q>.</p>

  <h1>Reviews</h1>
  <blockquote>
  <p>The culinary art of the food truck vendor has been steadily
  improving over the last 10 years with fine offerings from
  Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai.
  Sajja Adulet is to be congratulated for offering delicious
  and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. We think
  Curbside Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off
  the streets of Charlotte.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street fare
  and we all accept its limitations in exchange for the
  convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you
  don't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a
  master chef at several fine establishments on the East Coast,
  Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dining to the
  Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.</p>
